# Lua Syntax

A parser for the syntax of the Lua programming language. For the purpose of
beautification, minification, static analysis, and so on.

Based off of several projects:

- [Go source parser](https://golang.org/pkg/go/)
- [lua-minify](https://github.com/stravant/lua-minify)

## Go

This directory contains the parser as written in the Go programming language.
Why Go? It's easier to work with. The Go source will be translated to Lua once
the codebase is more solid.
